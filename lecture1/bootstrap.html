    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>Here is to the crazy ones: the misfits, the rebel, the trouble makers, the round pegs in the square holes, the ones who think differently, they have no found of rules and they have no respect of the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. But the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change thing, they ush the human race forward. When others see them as crazy ones, we see genius. For the people crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.</p>
